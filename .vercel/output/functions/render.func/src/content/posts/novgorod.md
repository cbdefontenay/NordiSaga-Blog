# The German Hanse in Novgorod

The **German Hanse** was a league of merchant guilds and towns that played a significant role in medieval trade. One of its key trading partners was the city of **Novgorod** in what is now Russia. Here's a brief overview of their interactions:

## Introduction

The Hanseatic League, often referred to as the Hanse, was a confederation of merchant guilds and their market towns that operated in the late Middle Ages. These merchants established trade routes that connected various parts of Europe, including the city of Novgorod.

## Hanse in Novgorod

The German Hanse established a presence in Novgorod, one of the most prominent trading centers in Eastern Europe during the 13th century. They engaged in the exchange of goods, including furs, salt, and metals, between Novgorod and Hanseatic towns in Northern Germany.

## Decline

Over time, the Hanseatic League faced challenges, and their influence waned. The league began to decline in the late 15th century, and their presence in Novgorod gradually diminished.

The interaction between the German Hanse and Novgorod is a fascinating chapter in medieval trade history, showcasing the international connections and economic significance of these entities.
